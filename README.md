Repo for my project using pandas
Two projects, Heroes of Pymoli and PyCitySchools
Heroes of Pymoli analyzes the revenue from in-app purchases of a game.
PyCitySchools analyzes school ditrict student performance on standardized tests to find trends.

Observations for Heroes of Pymoli:
Players in the age range of 20-24 years old make in-app purchases far more often than other age groups.

Males account for a larger proportion of transactions, but females seem to spend more when they do purchase something.

Items in the shop that have a higher item price also tend to be the most bought and account for more revenue than other items.


Observation for PyCitySchools:
Interestingly enough, it seems that schools that had less budget per student had students who did better in standardized testing.

Schools that are classed as Charter schools and those that are smaller also have students that perform better in standardized testing.
